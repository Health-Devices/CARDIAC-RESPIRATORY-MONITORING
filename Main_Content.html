The performance metrics  are considered for cases when true reference values are known. We also  consider more common situations in biomedical instrumentation where the  true reference values are unknown. In this case, we show how one can  calculate the agreement between the results obtained from two devices.  Uncertainty quantification is of utmost importance during measurements  since the result of any measurement contains the error, and the exact  value of the error cannot be computed without having the true reference  value. Uncertainties in measurements are modeled and calculated based on the probability theory. Therefore, we introduce the concept of  confidence intervals and uncertainty propagation. Sensitivity analysis  allows for selecting parameters whose variations affect the output the  most. Even though we present basic mathematical analysis, we focus on  computational methods and simulation. </span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Probability</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/CLT/CLT_CI.html"><span>Central Limit Theorem and confidence intervals</span></a><span>, Example 1.1, Fig. 1.1-1.2</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Sensor model, accuracy and agreement</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/SensorModel/accuracy.html"><span>Sensor model, evaluating accuracy and non_linearities</span></a><span>, Example 1.2, Fig. 1.3-1.6</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/BlandAltman/CreatingABlandAltmanPlot.html"><span>Bland Altman plot</span></a><span>, Example 1.3, Fig. 1.7</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Uncertainty propagation</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/Uncertainty/UncertaintyPropagation.html"><span>Uncertainty propagation of correlated variables and GUM</span></a><span>, Example 1.4, Example 1.5</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/Uncertainty/Uncertainty_diff_ampl1.html"><span>Uncertainty propagation in a differential amplifier</span></a><span>, Example 1.6a, Fig. 1.10, 1.11</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Sensitivity analysis</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter1/Sensitivity/Sens_analysis.html"><span>Sensitivity analysis of a differential amplifier,</span></a><span> Example 1.6b, Fig. 1.12</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></div><h2  class = 'S6' id = 'H_CD605C42' ><span>Chapter 2 Transducers</span></h2><div  class = 'S2'><span>In this chapter we introduce transducers that are commonly used in biomedical devices.

ECG signal is related to the electrical activity of the heart and therefore it is measured using electrodes. When measuring ECG signal, we first need to know where to place and how to connect the electrodes – this is described in the part of the chapter that talks about the ECG leads. In pervasive computing, mainly two to three electrodes are used representing single lead ECG configuration. We briefly introduce how the ECG signal can be generated using simulators, sources of noise and artifacts and how to measure the quality of the signals. ECG device types and standards are introduced next. To develop electronics for ECG, we need to know what standards/regulations need to be followed as well as what kind of processing will be performed. Therefore, next we will introduce algorithms for heart rate estimation and beat segmentation. The next section is about ECG electronics followed by the current solutions and research direction. In the end, we discuss how ECG signal can be further processed to extract heart rate variability.</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>	</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Signal properties, simulators and databases</span><span>	</span><span>		</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter7/Simulator/ECGSimulation.html"><span>Simulators</span></a><span>, Fig. 7.4</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Processing ECG signal			</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter7/ECG Processing/ECGProcessing_notebook.html"><span>Heart rate estimation and segmentation of the ECG signal</span></a><span>, Fig. 7.7</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Simulation of a single lead ECG system  		</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter7/ECGFrontEnd/Electrodes.html"><span>Simulation, front-end circuits, interference in ECG circuits</span></a><span>, Fig. 7.9-7.16</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span></span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>Current trends and research directions	</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span>    </span><a href = "Chapter7/HRV/github_repo/HRVTool"><span>Heart rate variability</span></a><span>, Fig. 7.18</span></div><div  class = 'S2'><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></div><h2  class = 'S6' id = 'H_3C64558A' ><span>Chapter 8 </span><span style=' font-weight: bold;'>Devices based on Time Difference between Signals: Continuous Blood Pressure Measurements</span></h2><div  class = 'S2'><span>In this chapter, we will show ways of combining different signals by looking mainly at time difference between characteristic points on the pulses from these signals obtained during the same cardiac cycle. It has been shown that time delay between the signals called pulse transit time is proportional to blood pressure and therefore it is a basis for continuous blood pressure devices. This chapter is different from the others in a way that the relationship between the temporal features and the parameter of interest is given through a mathematical model and therefore the most important part when developing the device for continuous blood pressure is the model that relates the parameters and the pressure. Therefore, we will focus more on modeling and less on instrumentation in this chapter.

%% Chapter 1 Concepts in Performance Evaluation and Uncertainty Analysis
% This chapter presents steps needed to evaluate performance and quantify  uncertainty
% in biomedical monitoring devices. The performance metrics  are considered for
% cases when true reference values are known. We also  consider more common situations
% in biomedical instrumentation where the  true reference values are unknown.
% In this case, we show how one can  calculate the agreement between the results
% obtained from two devices.  Uncertainty quantification is of utmost importance
% during measurements  since the result of any measurement contains the error,
% and the exact  value of the error cannot be computed without having the true
% reference  value. Uncertainties in measurements are modeled and calculated based
% on the probability theory. Therefore, we introduce the concept of  confidence
% intervals and uncertainty propagation. Sensitivity analysis  allows for selecting
% parameters whose variations affect the output the  most. Even though we present
% basic mathematical analysis, we focus on  computational methods and simulation.

% In this chapter, we describe the principles of modeling biomedical systems
% as well as propagating the uncertainty through the system and  performing sensitivity
% analysis. The objective is to put together  components and techniques studied
% in Chapters 2-4 in the context of  modeling a biomedical device. We describe
% models that allow us to  generate data, add noise and interference, include
% tolerance of the  electronic components, and so on. In addition, we consider
% systems that  are modeled using mathematical models as well as using electrical
% circuits and show how one can propagate uncertainties through both  models.
% We show how one can develop an end-to-end model that includes  different sub-models
% presented before and where processing is done in  software or analog hardware.

%% Chapter 6 Device based on photoplethismogram and pulse oximetry
% In this chapter, we describe operation behind photoplethysmography (PPG) and
% pulse oximetry devices. These devices are mainly used for estimating heart rate
% and oxygen saturation level noninvasively. We start with explaining what is
% measured with PPG and pulse oximetry and what the issues are in the measurements.
% We present PPG and pulse oximetry systems, sensors, circuits and algorithms.
% More advanced topics that are covered include: propagation of the light through
% the skin and modeling the complete system that includes models of tissue and
% the propagation of light through the skin as well as the sensor and the circuit.
% In the end of the chapter, we explain how one can use PPG signal to estimate

%% Chapter 7 *Devices based on the ECG Signal*
% In this chapter we discuss issues related with acquisition and processing
% of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. ECG signal is related to the electrical activity
% of the heart and therefore it is measured using electrodes. When measuring ECG
% signal, we first need to know where to place and how to connect the electrodes
% – this is described in the part of the chapter that talks about the ECG leads.
% In pervasive computing, mainly two to three electrodes are used representing
% single lead ECG configuration. We briefly introduce how the ECG signal can be
% generated using simulators, sources of noise and artifacts and how to measure
% the quality of the signals. ECG device types and standards are introduced next.
% To develop electronics for ECG, we need to know what standards/regulations need
% to be followed as well as what kind of processing will be performed. Therefore,
% next we will introduce algorithms for heart rate estimation and beat segmentation.
% The next section is about ECG electronics followed by the current solutions
% and research direction. In the end, we discuss how ECG signal can be further
% processed to extract heart rate variability.

%% Chapter 8 *Devices based on Time Difference between Signals: Continuous Blood Pressure Measurements*
% In this chapter, we will show ways of combining different signals by looking
% mainly at time difference between characteristic points on the pulses from these
% signals obtained during the same cardiac cycle. It has been shown that time
% delay between the signals called pulse transit time is proportional to blood
% pressure and therefore it is a basis for continuous blood pressure devices.
% This chapter is different from the others in a way that the relationship between
% the temporal features and the parameter of interest is given through a mathematical
% model and therefore the most important part when developing the device for continuous
% blood pressure is the model that relates the parameters and the pressure. Therefore,
% we will focus more on modeling and less on instrumentation in this chapter.
% In addition, we will discuss arterial stiffness and oscillometric blood pressure
% devices based on time differences between signals.

%% Chapter 9 *Continuous monitoring of breathing*
% In this chapter, we describe operation of devices for acquiring breathing
% signal and then estimating breathing rate. We introduce devices that can extract
% breathing signal from cardiac signals such as ECG and PPG as well as devices
% that obtain breathing signal based on movements of the chest wall of by measuring
% temperature or pressure changes during inhalation and exhalation. In addition,
% we show some developments of wearable devices for tidal volume and airflow measurements
% as well as systems for classifying breathing patterns.

%% Chapter 10 Wearable devices
% Wearable devices are becoming pervasive. They can sense vital signs for hours
% and days. They come in different shapes and forms and can measure several quantities
% of interest and estimate multiple indices. Some issues related to the design
% of wearable devices are discussed in this chapter, such as power consumption.
% We showed several examples of how power consumption can be estimated. We also
% introduce different classifications of wearable devices. Sensors and sensing
% modalities currently used in wearable devices were mainly covered in previous
% chapters. In this chapter, we introduce three biomedical signals: seismocardiogram,
% arterial tonometry signal, and phonocardiogram. Examples of commercial and research-based
% wearable devices are shown at the end of the chapter.

%% Chapter 11 Conclusion and research directions: beyond wearable devices
% The goal of this chapter is to review topics covered in the book, point out
% new directions and challenges, and present alternative approaches to continuous
% monitoring of patients. We discuss approaches where the patient is not required
% to wear any devices. Instead, the sensors are integrated into the objects that
% patients use, such as a chair or a bed. In addition, we discuss long-range contactless
% monitoring where sensors, such as radars and cameras,  are integrated into the
% environment where patients live.

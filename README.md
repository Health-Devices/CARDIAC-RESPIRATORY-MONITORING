Publisher: Elsevier <br>
Expected publication date: January 2022 <br>



### Description:
PERVASIVE CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY MONITORING DEVICES is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students in electrical and biomedical engineering as well as industry professionals. It is intended to become a textbook for courses related to wearable devices and biomedical instrumentation. The book covers todayâ€™s pervasive cardiac and respiratory devices used outside of the hospital as well as it addresses emerging technologies such as non-invasive cuff-less monitoring of blood pressure, estimation of arterial stiffness and so on. 
Students and researchers reading this book will be provided jump start in learning about the technologies for cardiac and respiratory monitoring or in continuing research related to these technologies. They will be able to rely on developed Matlab models, worked out examples on how to use models and perform sensitivity analysis as well as pointers to research directions. We hope that the book will allow for training more researchers and developers and for accelerating R&D in this exciting field.

The multiple biomedical signal collection includes 4 signals (ECG, PPG, PCG, SCG) in 6 channels (ECG, PPG, PCG, SCG_Z, SCG_X, SCG_Y).

Sampling frequency: 8008Hz (set to 8000Hz, but is 8008Hz exactly).

Sensor:
ECG: Lead I ECG, ECG electrodes on left and right wrists with left leg as active ground.
PPG: optical PPG on left wrist
PCG: microphone on chest
SCG: 3-axial accelerometer, SCG (heart beats) and respiratory waveform can be mainly observed from Z axis. 

Data were collected with a reference breath rate (BR) at 12bpm, 14 bpm and 16 bpm as marked in file name.
